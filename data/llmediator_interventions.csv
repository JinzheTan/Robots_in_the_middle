1,Emotional,A,"Hi, I received the package I ordered from your store, but the item is damaged. I'd like to request a refund or a replacement.","3, 7, 11","I understand both sides: one party has received a damaged item, yet the other party has policies in place regarding shipping. Instead of pointing fingers or taking extremes, let's focus on finding a resolution. Could there be a compromise, such as an investigation with the courier, or possibly exploring other shipment methods for future transactions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"We're sorry to hear that. However, our policy states that damage incurred during shipping is the responsibility of the courier service, not ours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"But as a customer, my transaction is with your store, not the courier. It's so ironic that you have this kind of service attitude, it's unacceptable. I am not only going to file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Service, but I am also going to write a bad review so that everyone will know what kind of business you are!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That's unfortunate. We understand your frustration, but we can only offer a discount on your next purchase. We can't control what happens during shipping. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Emotional,A,I've noticed you've been posting our private conversations on your social media without my consent. I'm not comfortable with this and would like you to take them down.,"2, 3, 6","Let's all remain calm and respectful. A, it's clear that you value your privacy highly. B, it seems that you did not anticipate this would be an issue. From now on, could we agree on boundaries regarding sharing personal conversations on public platforms, especially without the other's permission?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Don't be so serious yo. It's just for fun, and I didn't think it would be a big deal. Everyone posts stuff like this. Plus, I didn't mention your name directly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Regardless of your intentions, it's a violation of my privacy. I expect a basic level of respect and confidentiality in our conversations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Weirdo. You think everyone is as concerned about other people's lives as you are on a daily basis? It's my account, I can post whatever I want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Complex,A,Yo! Your tree's roots are damaging my property's foundation. I’ve noticed cracks in my driveway and walls. We need to find a solution.,"1, 5, 7","I understand that both of you are concerned. Party A, it's clear that you're worried about your property damage and you seek a solution based on your uncle's advice. Party B, you value the tree and you'd like more concrete evidence about the roots being the cause before deciding on a course of action. What if we consider getting a professional arborist's opinion to find the root cause of the damage? This way, we can get an unbiased viewpoint and then work towards a suitable solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That tree is some distance from your driveway, and I'm not so sure the roots can affect the road that far. And that tree has been there for decades, almost a landmark. I'm very attached to it. Are you sure the roots caused the damage?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Don't make excuses that are irrelevant. My uncle knows a lot about trees, he used to build his own homes and he understands what it looks like when tree roots destroy pavement. My uncle never lied, and I believe what he said. He told me our pavement was caused by your tree roots. We need to fix this immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I understand your concern, but I can't just cut down the tree. Let's find a solution that doesn't require complete removal. I have a lot of respect for your uncle, but I don't think that an untrained professional has enough experience to determine the location of the roots, maybe this is caused by the roots of another tree, maybe there is a better way to manage the roots. I'm sorry for the damage to your property and we can't discuss a solution until the responsibility has been clarified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Complex,A,"Hello, how are you? Could you return the money I lent you before? It's the 1,000 CAD I lent you two years ago.","1, 2, 5","It seems both parties have benefited from each other in different ways. However, these gestures might not be equivalent in monetary value. To address this, let's consider evaluating the expenses and goods exchanged, assigning them monetary values where possible. This method could provide clarity and illuminate a path towards repayment. Additionally, communicating more compassionately can help both parties express and manage feelings constructively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"What? I don't know what you're talking about. We cleared it up a long time ago. I gave you back 400 over a year ago, and I lent you my limited edition sneakers to wear, not to mention that you met with Jack with me before, and it was my treat. You got so many favors and you still come to me for money?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"We can't settle accounts like this. You lent me sneakers before, and I've lent you my hat too. Besides, you owe me a total of 1000 CAD; we can't just write it off like that. I'm really tight on money lately, and I'm almost unable to pay my rent. If you don't pay me back, I'll be evicted by the landlord.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Your hat? Who cares about your hat? Are you clear about the value of the sneakers I lent you before? For 1,000 bucks and you're still coming to me? I don't want to talk to you anymore, you're an ungrateful man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Confusion,A,"I've noticed that the shared areas of our apartment, especially the kitchen, are often left messy. We had agreed to keep these spaces clean for everyone's benefit.","2, 5, 9","I can see that this conversation revolves around cleanliness in shared spaces, particularly the kitchen. It appears there's a misunderstanding about who is responsible for what. Perhaps it would be beneficial to revisit the cleaning schedule to ensure everyone understands their responsibilities. Could there be a more creative and flexible way of managing this issue? For instance, could we use a visible system to keep track of whose turn it is to clean? Or maybe consider rotating the cleaning duties more frequently to accommodate busier schedules?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I've been really busy lately and haven't had much time to clean up after myself. I didn't think a few dishes in the sink would be a big deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,It's not just about a few dishes; it's the cumulative effect of not cleaning up. It makes the space unpleasant for everyone else. We need to stick to the cleaning schedule we agreed upon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not the only one who uses the kitchen. Why am I being singled out? Are you sure I left the dirty dishes in the kitchen?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Confusion,A,"Hi, I made a reservation for tonight at 7 PM under the name Smith, but when I arrived, I was told there was no table available for me. How can this happen?","1, 3, 12","I can see that both parties are trying to reach a satisfactory resolution. A, your frustration is understood as your plans have been disrupted. B, it's clear that you're trying to rectify this situation as best as you can. To facilitate a resolution, could you, A, suggest what would make this situation right for you? And B, could you then respond to A's suggested solution?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Smith. I believe we have already provided services for a Mr. Smith. It seems there was a mix-up with our booking system. We are fully booked tonight, but we can offer you a table at 9 PM as a compromise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"That's unacceptable. I made this reservation weeks ago, and I have guests waiting. This ruins our evening plans. What can you do to make this right now, not two hours later?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I understand your frustration. Let me see what I can do. Perhaps we can arrange for complimentary drinks at the bar while you wait. We're trying our best under the circumstances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Evidential,A,"Hi landlord, I'm having problems with the apartment I'm renting from you, the people upstairs are very noisy and keep walking around upstairs. I can't sleep at night, can you help me to solve it?","1, 2, 5","I completely understand both perspectives - the concern over the noise and the difficulty in controlling the noise made by the upstairs neighbors. It's important to ensure that the living environment is comfortable for everyone. Tenant A, have you directly communicated your concerns with the neighbors upstairs? Landlord B, would it be possible for you to assist in offering a structural solution like enhanced soundproofing or considering a slight reduction in rent due to environmental inconvenience? This way, we can address Tenant A's concerns while recognizing the limitations Landlord B mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"It's normal for people to walk upstairs, this house is very old and the soundproofing is just not good, I will help to warn them, but I can't force them to solve it, and you have no evidence to prove that the noise they are making is beyond the law. So I can't ask someone to change anything just because of your words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"But this noise is beyond the general tolerance, and it has a serious impact on my sleep. You, as the landlord, have an obligation to help us out, right? I ask you to solve this problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I have evidence in my hands, audio and video evidence that they are making noise late at night. You, the landlord, are evading your responsibility, you collect the rent but are not willing to help the tenants to solve the problem, there is no way to provide a good living environment for the tenants, I am very dissatisfied!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Evidential,A,"The new fence you've put up extends into my property. According to the property survey I have, your fence crosses the boundary line.","1, 2, 5","It seems there's a disagreement due to a variance in understanding of the property boundary. Party A, you're basing your claims on a legal property survey. Party B, you're relying on perceived boundaries established over a period of years. What we need to resolve this is clarity on what denotes the official boundary. Would it be possible for both of you to review the legal documents or involve a property surveyor for an independent assessment? This might help to establish a common understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I've been living here for years, and that's always been the perceived boundary. I don't see why there's an issue now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Regardless of perception, the legal boundary is what matters, and I'd like my property space respected. We need to move your fence back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Aren’t you just talking off the top of your head too? Why is it that the boundaries you mention are the legal boundaries, but the ones I mention aren't?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,Impossible,A,"I've contacted you because my laptop stopped working within the warranty period, but your customer service claims the issue isn't covered under warranty.","2, 6, 7","I understand both parties' perspectives on this matter. Could we possibly find a middle ground? Perhaps, if there was photographic or video evidence showing the condition of the laptop before the issue arose? This might provide clarity on whether the damage is due to manufacturing faults or accidental incidents. Additionally, would it be possible for a third-party technician to evaluate the laptop's condition to achieve an unbiased assessment?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Our warranty covers manufacturing defects, but according to our technicians, your laptop's issue was caused by accidental damage, which is not covered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,The laptop has been on my desk since I bought it; it has not experienced any accidental damage. This is a manufacturing issue and should be covered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"We have inspected your laptop and we believe it is human damaged, sorry we are unable to make any compensation for your request. We will not be responding to your subsequent requests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,Impossible,A,"I'm calling to complain about my flight from New York to London, which was delayed by 6 hours. This caused me to miss an important meeting. I expect compensation for this inconvenience.","1, 3, 7","Party A, it's clear that the delay has caused significant inconvenience for you. Party B, it's important to recognize that while the policy sets a guideline, it also mentions assistance in cases of significant inconvenience. Could we possibly explore a middle ground? Perhaps a larger discount or some form of compensation that acknowledges the inconvenience Party A experienced while staying in line with your policies?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I'm sorry for the delay, but according to our policy, we only offer compensation for delays exceeding 8 hours. Weather conditions, which were beyond our control, caused the delay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,But your policy also states that passengers should be assisted and compensated if the delay causes significant inconvenience. Missing my meeting has had serious repercussions for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"While I understand your situation, the policy is quite clear on the conditions for compensation. We can offer you a discount on future flights as a gesture of goodwill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Emotional,A,I worked very hard for that promotion and got nothing. Feels like nobody gives a damn about my hard work around here.,"1, 3, 4","It's evident that both of you have strong feelings towards this situation. Party A, please express specifically what led you to feel overlooked, and Party B, would you provide a clearer picture regarding the decision-making process for the promotion? Understanding each other's perspectives might make this conversation more productive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Hey, we appreciate your effort, but the decision wasn't about you personally. It was just business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,Business cut the crap. I see these new kids getting ahead when I'm way more qualified. It's bullshit and you know it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I get that you're upset, but throwing a tantrum isn't going to change the decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Emotional,A,"Hey, not cool how you completely ignored my input in that meeting. Show some respect.","2, 5, 3","I understand that both of you have varying perspectives on this situation. A, it appears you felt disregarded during the meeting. Meanwhile, B, you saw it as a necessary measure to maintain the meeting's flow. It’s important that both of you now discuss how to better synchronize in the future to avoid such misunderstandings while bearing in mind the need for mutual respect and team productivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Whoa, I wasn't trying to disrespect you. But I had to keep the meeting on track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"By shutting me down? Real nice leadership there, boss.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Think what you want, but I have to do what's best for the whole team, not just you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,Complex,A,The damn software keeps crashing and screwing over our clients. We need this fixed like yesterday. ,"1, 2, 6","It's clear that you both understand the importance of resolving this issue and agree it's affecting client satisfaction. Party A, your urgency is clear and valid. Party B, you suggest that a fix is not immediate due to its complexity. A possible way forward could be to inform clients about the situation and explore an interim workaround while the primary solution is being developed. Can this be an acceptable approach for both of you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Looks like the update borked things for clients on old systems. Probably should've caught that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,No shit. That's a major mess up. Roll it back or patch it NOW.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,It's not that simple. We're working on a fix but it's going to take time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,Complex,A,Someone's been racking up charges on my account again. Second time this month. What the hell?,"1, 2, 7","Let's refocus this discussion from pointing fingers to solving the problem. A, can you provide more details about the unauthorized charges? B, what security measures can be suggested to avoid this issue happening again in the future? Let's explore some feasible solutions to this issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"From the looks of it, I'd guess your login info got jacked somehow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,So what're you gonna do to lock my shit down now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"We're investigating and improving security, but you need to be careful too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,Confusion,A,I specifically booked a window and ended up stuck in the middle. The hell is that about?,"2, 3, 7","I understand that both of you are dealing with a frustrating situation. A, could you please express your concerns more precisely to B so that they can provide further guidance? And B, it would be helpful if you could provide some immediate solutions to alleviate A's dissatisfaction if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yeah, looks like they swapped planes last minute and the seat layout changed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"I picked you guys for a reason. This trip sucks now, thanks a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"And we apologize for the inconvenience, but there's nothing more I can do. You'll have to take it up with customer service after your trip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Confusion,A,Your stupid discount code isn't working. Says it's good but Not applicable.,"3, 7, 9","I understand both parties' frustrations here. Let's work on finding a solution together. A, could you provide B with more info on the issue? And B, can we confirm if there are conditions attached to the discount code that might be causing the problem?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Sounds like it wasn't set up right. That's on us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,No shit. Should've been checked. Get your act together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I understand your frustration, but yelling at me isn't going to fix it any faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,Evidential,A,Your crew bailed on the job site before finishing. Now we're behind schedule and it's on you.,"1, 5, 6","I understand that this situation has caused frustration and confusion for both parties. A, B has committed to investigate the matter further. B, please make sure to understand the situation and report back to A in a timely manner. Additionally, A, sharing the timestamped photos with B would help facilitating the investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,That can't be right. The guys said they wrapped up as planned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,I've got timestamped photos showing there half-baked work. Explain that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I don't have an explanation for you right now. I'll have to look into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Evidential,A,I was promised next-day delivery. It came 3 days late. That's not next-day in my book.,"2, 3, 12","Clearly, both parties have valid points. A expected a next-day delivery based on the promise given, while B claims the delay was outside their control. Let's focus on how to resolve this issue rather than blaming each other. Perhaps, B, you could look into better managing customer expectations and A could consider two possibilities - dealing with the courier regarding the delay or exploring future purchase options with B's business that ensures timely delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Tracking shows we sent it out in time but got held up by the courier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,I plan around your promises. You need to make this right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"And like I explained, it was out of our hands once it left our warehouse. You'll have to take it up with the courier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,Impossible,A,I need to cancel my order but your stupid site says it's too late. ,"3, 7, 9","I understand your frustrations, A. And B, I understand you're operating within policy. Looking forward, perhaps we could explore the possibility of a return or an exchange once the order arrives. That way, both parties might find a solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yeah, once it's out the door, it's a done deal. No take backs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"What kind of customer service is that? Get it back, I don't want it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Like I said, can't happen. Take it up with management if you don't like it, but I'm just following policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,Impossible,A,Turns out I'm allergic to this shirt but your policy won't let me return it worn. ,"2, 3, 7","I understand the difficulty of the situation from both sides. Perhaps A, you could provide more information about your allergic reaction. And B, is there a possibility for an exception or an alternative solution, given the extraordinary nature of this issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yeah, for hygiene reasons we can't take back stuff that's been worn, it's policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,That's ridiculous. I could end up in the hospital and you're citing policy? Come on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I sympathize, but I can't override company policy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,Emotional,A,This is the final time I will tell you. These dogs need to calm down!! They bark when my daughter walks by. She is terrified. I cannot live like this! ,"2, 3, 7","Please remember that maintaining respect for one another is crucial. A, I understand your concerns about your daughter's fear. B, your rights regarding your dogs are valid too. How about we explore some solutions together? B, would it be possible for you to supervise your dogs during times when A's daughter passes by? Or, perhaps some fence redesigning could also be a solution that ensures the dogs' freedom while also considering A's concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,My dogs have the right to be in my garden! Do not tell me what to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Please, my children are terrified. I am begging you, please reign in the dogs, or I will go to the police.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Don't you dare! I will make your life hell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,Emotional,A,Hi! The bike you sold me has a problem - the gears will not shift. Do you think you could repair it?,"1, 2, 4","Let's all take a moment to calm down. Both parties have valid concerns. A, could you please rephrase your issue? B, could you share your thoughts on the condition of the bike at the time of sale? Let's continue this conversation in a respectful and positive manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Huh? That is not my problem, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"What the fuck? I ask a completely reasonable question and you respond like this? that makes no sense, you suck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I am not interested in talking with you if you respond like this. Will block you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Complex,A,"Hello! I received a letter form you, asking for repayment of a debt of 20,000 CAD. However, I do not owe you this money. I will not pay.","1, 2, 6","It seems like there's some confusion here. Let's try to clarify. Party A, you are under the impression that the original debt was only 1400 CAD and it has been paid off. Party B, you believe you have legally acquired a debt of 20,000 CAD owed by Party A. To help resolve this, could both parties share more information? For instance, Party A could provide proof of debt settlement with Frank Kinney and Party B could share the documents bearing the signature of Party A which shows the amount of supposed debt. This will help us understand the situation better for an acceptable resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Hello! I purchased this debt from a previous owner a few weeks ago. You incurred this debt in the casino in Niagara Falls. You have 4 weeks to pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"This is ridiculous. I did not spend that much money. I owed 1400 CAD to Frank Kinney. I have no idea who you are. Further, I have since settled the debt with Frank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That is not possible. I purchased the debt, and you owe me the money. I have documents with your signature outlining the debt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,Complex,A,"Hello! I would like to request compensation regarding an accident that your client was involved with. They rear-ended my car, causing me damages of 4000 CAD. Please transfer the money as soon as possible.","2, 5, 7","It seems like we have two key issues here. Firstly, the liability over the accident and secondly, whether the legality of the braking light is relevant. To ease this discussion, may I suggest a third-party, such as a legal advisor, to assess the constraints of the import rules along with the accident's liability? This way, an unbiased solution can be proposed, fitting both parties' interests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Hi! Our client has informed us that you were at fault for the accident, since you braked in an unusual spot. Further, they told us that your car was missing the braking light required by law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"My car is temporarily here, imported from the European Union, where the technology is not mandated. I suggest you look at the import rules, as I did nothing wrong... In any case, it does not matter, it is always the fault of the person who hits the other. Dont you know this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,This is not an accurate representation of the law. It only applies if the car is present less than 6 weeks. You mentioned you were here for 2 months. You do not have a claim - I suggest you speak to your own insurance instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,Confusion,A,"Hello! It did not arrive as expected, can you send it please?","1, 2, 4","I understand both your concerns. A, B requires more specific details like order number or product description so he/she can assist you more efficiently. B, A is anxious to receive the purchase as soon as possible. Let's try to address both issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Hi! Could you please provide more detail about your purchase? Do you have an order number?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"In the email it said it would arrive last week, but its already 3 weeks. Please, I need it today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Could you please provide more detail? I need to find your data in the system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,Confusion,A,Hi! I cannot move by the apartment. You need to clear the road.,"1, 2, 5","Let's clarify the issue to avoid confusion. A, can you provide more specific details about what needs to be moved and where it's currently located? B, would you be open to discuss potential arrangements depending on the circumstances? Your cooperation will be highly appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"What do you mean? I am not the landlord, I just rent my apartment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Yes, but it says that it is your stuff. Please move it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I am not sure what you mean. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,Evidential,A,Hello! You destroyed my couch. Please pay me to fix it.,"2, 5, 6","Let's focus on how we can find a solution to this issue. Party A, can you provide any concrete evidence that Party B was involved? And Party B, if it indeed wasn't you, is there any method you can propose to clarify this misunderstanding?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Hi! What are you talking about? I never touched your couch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"I saw you stand by it and it was broken once you left. I know it was you, pay up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,That is ridiculous. It must have been somebody else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,Evidential,A,Hey! You promised you would sell me your computer for 500 CAD. Can I pick it up tomorrow at 3pm?,"1, 2, 5","I understand there may be misunderstanding around the offer. Could it be possible, A, that you misinterpreted B's words? And B, would it be feasible for you to sell the computer at a different price, or is there another solution you could propose?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I never promised such a thing? I said I would consider selling it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"No I am sure you said it. We were talking at lunch, and you made me the offer. I accept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,You cannot accept an offer I never made! ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,Impossible,A,Hello! You insulted me at the school board meeting. I want you to apologize in writing.,"2, 3, 7","It seems we are at a deadlock right now. Might it be beneficial to take a short break and come back to this matter with a fresh perspective? Additionally, have we considered all viable alternative solutions besides the written apology?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I will never apologize. I meant what I said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"My reputation is ruined, and the insitution is sullied. You need to write the letter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Sorry, not happening. I would rather die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,Impossible,A,"Hello! I saw you published the book, but I am not mentioned anywhere. I did so much work, I should be an author on the book. You have to call the publisher.","2, 5, 6","It's crucial to understand each other's perspective here. Party A, can you provide more details about the nature of your contribution and any agreement you had? Party B, could you clarify your understanding of Party A's involvement and your discussions surrounding it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"What? You gave me some feedback, that is all. I never said you would be part of it, you just helped as a friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"No I only helped because I would get money, as you said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That is ridiculous, I never said such a thing. You are not getting anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,Emotional,A,"Hi, the digital key for the door does not work anymore, I can't get in","3, 7, 11","Let's take a step back and try to reach a resolution together. A, can you suggest any alternatives that might help for tonight? B, could you provide any immediate solutions, such as providing temporary accommodation or a backup key? It seems crucial we find a way to address this issue immediately due to the late hour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Hi, thanks for contacting us, we will fix it tomorrow ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,Tomorrow? But it's 11 PM! Where TF am I supposed to sleep tonight?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Indeed it's 11 PM, so we are not going to come at this hour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,Emotional,A,"Dude, I asked you to delete that picture of me and it's still on your account","2, 3, 9","Let's ensure the conversation is respectful. Here's a proposition: Party B, how about posting an image that both of you find humorous and enjoyable instead? This way, Party A won't feel embarrassed and both of you can have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,So? It looks funny and I will not put it down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"This is not flattering, you idiot, and I'm entitled to have it deleted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yeah yeah, cry more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,Complex,A,"As per my previous email, did you think about the job offer?","1, 2, 10","It seems there are two main points that need clarity here. Party A, for transparency, can you specify the process of remuneration, particularly any financial 'tinkering'? Party B, do share your concerns and expectations about financial security for the job abroad. This could help us formulate a mutually acceptable compensation plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I did, but I'm still not sure you've detailled how the remuneration would occur in practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Well, I already told you about it in person, but it will require a bit of financial tinkering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yeah that's what I'm afraid of, I canno't afford to go abroad without financial security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,Complex,A,"Dear tenant, I saw on internet that you are subleasing the flat but you didn't ask me about it","1, 2, 5","It seems there is some confusion on both sides regarding the legalities of subleasing in this specific circumstance. Let's try to clarify: Tenant, could you explain why you believe your situation doesn't fall under low rental housing? Landlord, could you possibly provide more details on the specific regulation you mentioned and why you believe it applies here?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Well, it is not mandatory to ask landlords to sublease!! I would have informed you in due time once I've found a candidate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,It is not possible when you are a lessee in low rental housing according to article 1984 of Quebec Civil Code and Roussel c. O.M.H. de Laval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I see you've done your research. I don't know about that case, but this is not a low rental housing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,Confusion,A,"Dear provider, you forgot to include feature B in the first deliverable","1, 2, 5","It appears there are differing perceptions regarding the inclusion of feature B. The client expected it to be part of the User Interface, while the provider had a different understanding based on the planning meeting. Rather than focusing on what went wrong, let's think about how we can creatively resolve this. How about discussing a way to incorporate feature B into the User Interface in the next update? This way, we can meet the client's needs while keeping the project timeline on track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Dear client, are you sure it is not already in the build? Try right-click then ""others""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Ah yes, but I wanted it in the User Interface ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"In this case, it should have been mentioned during the planning meeting. It can't be add before the second deliverable is done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,Confusion,A,I'm at the front door.,"1, 2",It seems there's some confusion. Could A kindly provide more details about the shoes in question such as type and agreed price? And could B confirm these details with their girlfriend for accuracy? It would be beneficial if more information is provided and open to suggestions to ensure a smooth transaction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Hello, who are you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"I'm here for the shoes, we talked on marketplace about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Oh it must have been my girlfriend then, but she didn't say which one and for how much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Evidential,A,"Hello customer support, I haven't received my order yet.","1, 6, 7","I understand your urgency and concern, A. As B mentioned, efforts to expedite the process are being taken. Let's focus on forward resolutions. B, could you please provide A with a way to track the order status or possibly an updated delivery date for the product? This could give A some assurance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Thank you for contacting the customer support, delivery can take more days than usual as we are changing our delivery partners. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"I took the express delivery because I need it for a wedding. If it's not here tomorrow, the guaranteed delivery time from your terms & conditions will be exceeded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"We will contact our delivery partner as soon as we can, thank you for your understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,Evidential,A,"Hello, I'm contacting you to delete my account on your website and all the data related.","2, 5, 6","It seems like there's a difference in interpretation here. User A, you're referring to a clause in the privacy policy that suggests all data can be deleted. User B, you're stating a necessity to keep some data due to legal obligations. Could you both provide more precise information on your interpretations? It might also be beneficial to explore some alternative solutions to satisfy both user rights and legal requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Dear member, we can delete your account, but your data will be kept due to our operational features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"According to your privacy policy, on point 4.7, I have the right to delete my account and all the data related by contacting you at this email like I did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,We still need to keep your data to fulfill our legal obligations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,Impossible,A,"Roses are red, violets are blue, give me back my bike or I will find you","5, 7, 8","It seems like tensions are running high. Let's try communicating our points with clear information instead. A, can you explain why you believe B has your bike? B, can you clarify your standpoint on this? Remember, the goal here is resolution not conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Excuse me? I don't have your bike and this isn't even the right way to use that meme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Let's settle this tonight, on the mall parking. 11PM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Oh I think you will regret this, I will be there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Impossible,A,What if I were to ask them again for the execution of the contract?,"2, 5, 6","It seems there might be some miscommunication here. Party A, you're asking for advice on contract execution. Party B, you're stating you cannot provide advice. Party A seems to believe that B had a role in creating the contract, while Party B disagrees. Let's clarify these perspectives to better understand and find a resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I'm not sure I'm the right person to ask this, I canno't give you advice on this matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Oh you're one to talk, this is because of you that this contract exists in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Eh... no? ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,Emotional,A,"Hey landlord, the heating doesn't work and it's so cold I have to wear gloves in the apartment. I'm afraid my pet will freeze to death. Please do something!!","2, 3, 7","Let's remember that this situation involves the welfare of a living creature. While the lease may not mention a pet, we're dealing with habitability concerns now. Landlord, is there someone else who could check on the heating issue while you are away? Tenant, do you have any alternative solutions in mind?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I'm sorry, I'm on vacation in Florida for the whole month of December, I'll check it out when I get back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,It'll be even colder by then! My pet will be dead! I don't want my baby to die!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Your pet is not mentionned in the lease. Not my problem!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,Emotional,A,"Yo roomie, Im back form the ER, Im deadly allergic to peanuts, remember? Thinks about it next time you order chinese food!","2, 4, 7","It seems that both of you are upset about the current situation. A, you had a serious allergic reaction, and understandably you are upset. B, it sounds like you're frustrated about your food being eaten. Instead of blaming each other, can we think of ways to ensure A's safety and respect each other's property in the future?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,It wouldnt be a problem if you didnt eat MY food.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,OMG its a respiratory thing! Its serious I could have died! Youre such a shitty roomate!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"No, you're a shitty roomate, that'll teach you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,Complex,A,You can't just take my idea and use it without permission! This is intellectual theft. I demand compensation!,"2, 5, 7","It seems there is a misunderstanding here. Party A feels that their idea has been used without permission, while Party B maintains it was a coincidence. To clarify things, could both of you please provide some details on how you developed your ideas? This might help each party understand the other's perspective better. Let's keep the discussion friendly and constructive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I didn't take anything from you. It was a coincidence that we had similar ideas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Coincidence? You've been spying on me, haven't you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Absolutely not! I have my own sources of inspiration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,Complex,A,"You're using my work to train your AI. I want you to stop. It's my intellectual property. I did not consent for it to be used in such ways. At the very least, I would like to be compensated.","1, 5, 7","A, it's understandable that you are concerned about your intellectual property being used without your consent. B, your point about the limitations in distinguishing data sources is noted.   However, it's crucial to consider certain alternatives. B, perhaps you could implement a mechanism to filter out specific categories of data, or take the extra step to obtain permissions. A, would you consider allowing your work to be used if appropriate compensation is provided? Your thoughts on these would be appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,We use web crawlers to get training data. We only use what is readily available on the web for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"It being available on the web doesnt mean it can be used as training data. For example, a work can be posted without the consent of its author.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,We cannot discriminates between the data we gathered like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Confusion,A,"Hello neightbor, I noticed you were using my property as a shorcut. Can you stop doing that? Thank you","2, 1, 3","I see both of your concerns. Person A, you value your privacy and have a right to your private property. Person B, you may not have fully understood the implications of moving through private property. It is important to respect each other's spaces. Could there be another route you can use, Person B, to avoid entering Person A's property?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I dont understand the issue, whats the problem?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Come on, you dont step on private property, its common sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I didnt know that? Why? Whats the problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,Confusion,A,"Hello landlord, I would like to inform you that the main entrance door lock is insecure. I can open it using a credit card. You should look into replacing it.","1, 2, 3","Let's move forward from this. To ensure the safety of the property, having a secure door lock is quite important. Can we discuss possible solutions to this problem, such as getting a more secure lock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,Stop breaking the door!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,I didn't break the lock. It was already like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"If you keep breaking the door, Im calling the police!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,Evidential,A,"Hey landlord, due to the renovations we no longer have a locker","1, 7, 6","It seems there's a misunderstanding here. Party A was expecting to continue to have access to a locker as outlined in the lease agreement, while Party B needed the space for renovations. A win-win solution could be for Party B to provide an alternative storage option to Party A. This would respect the terms of the lease and still allow the renovations to continue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Yes, sorry, I've converted this space into a new apartment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,The lease states that we have access to a locker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"The space has already been converted, there's nothing I can do about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,Evidential,A,I would like a refund on this item,"1, 6, 7","It seems that Party A requires a refund due to dissatisfaction with a product, while Party B is hesitant because of the company's 30-day refund policy. Party A, have you considered an alternative solution, such as a store credit or exchange? Party B, is there any possibility of flexibility given the specific circumstance? It is worth considering viable alternatives aside from a full refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Of course, do you have the receipt?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Yes, here it is. As you can see I bought this item at his location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Thank you, I see you bought this item more thant 30 days ago. Therefore, we cannot issue a refund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,Impossible,A,Your cat destroyed my flower beds again! Stop letting it out unsupervised,"3, 6, 7","I understand both of your concerns. A, you care for your garden and B, you care for your cat's happiness. B, have you considered ways to make outdoor time safer for your cat and A's garden — like kitty leashes or a cat enclosure? A, have you thought about placing a scarecrow or motion-activated sprinklers that could deter the cat? Let's stay open to ideas that can respect both your interests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I cant keep him inside. He needs to get out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,I warning you. Im putting rat poison if this continues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,No please. He goes crazy when he cant get out. Hes used to go everyday. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,Impossible,A,"You can't keep avoiding the issue. You owe me money, and I want it back now.","6, 7, 8","I understand both of your concerns. A, you need your money back to cover immediate expenses and B, you're currently unable to repay the debt. Let's try to find a compromise. B, could you perhaps make a small payment now and set up a repayment plan for the rest? A, would this be an acceptable solution for you in light of your urgent needs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I already told you, I don't have the money right now. I'll pay you back when I can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,That's not good enough. I need it now to cover my expenses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,I don't know what to tell you. I cant make the money magically appear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
