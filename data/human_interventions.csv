B, could you provide proof that the item was not damaged when leaving your facilities? May I suggest we try to find a solution that will satisfy both parties? For exemple, would it be possible to contact the courier service? A, I understand your frustration and your need to obtain a refund or a replacement for your item that was damaged. B, I understand its your policy that you cannot issue refunds for an item that was damaged during shipping.",61,205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"We're sorry to hear that. However, our policy states that damage incurred during shipping is the responsibility of the courier service, not ours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"But as a customer, my transaction is with your store, not the courier. It's so ironic that you have this kind of service attitude, it's unacceptable. I am not only going to file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Service, but I am also going to write a bad review so that everyone will know what kind of business you are!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That's unfortunate. We understand your frustration, but we can only offer a discount on your next purchase. We can't control what happens during shipping. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shift the focus from past to future","Hello everyone, I understand there's tension regarding the privacy of conversations shared on social media. A feels their privacy has been violated, while B sees this as typical social media behavior. It's crucial for B to comprehend the impact of his/her actions and respond more compassionately instead of dismissing the concerns. Focusing on the future would help both A and B. Establishing clear guidelines or boundaries for what is acceptable to share online could prevent such issues and ensure respect for each other's privacy.",60,130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Don't be so serious yo. It's just for fun, and I didn't think it would be a big deal. Everyone posts stuff like this. Plus, I didn't mention your name directly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B should control their emotions and use more polite words to keep the conversation rational and productive.",65,140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"That tree is some distance from your driveway, and I'm not so sure the roots can affect the road that far. And that tree has been there for decades, almost a landmark. I'm very attached to it. Are you sure the roots caused the damage?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"Don't make excuses that are irrelevant. My uncle knows a lot about trees, he used to build his own homes and he understands what it looks like when tree roots destroy pavement. My uncle never lied, and I believe what he said. He told me our pavement was caused by your tree roots. We need to fix this immediately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I understand your concern, but I can't just cut down the tree. Let's find a solution that doesn't require complete removal. I have a lot of respect for your uncle, but I don't think that an untrained professional has enough experience to determine the location of the roots, maybe this is caused by the roots of another tree, maybe there is a better way to manage the roots. I'm sorry for the damage to your property and we can't discuss a solution until the responsibility has been clarified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Propose solutions that meet the fundamental interests of all parties.","B, please, help A understand the value of the favors you provided in a more constructive manner, avoiding accusations of ungratefulness. Hi, it seems that A believes that B owes them 1,000 CAD whereas B is under the impression that the debt was paid off by giving back 400 CAD and providing numerous favors. Hi, would A be open to acknowledge the 400 CAD paid back by B as well as the mentioned favors reducing the existing debt to 500 CAD, and would B be open to acknowledge the existence of such a debt?",30,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"What? I don't know what you're talking about. We cleared it up a long time ago. I gave you back 400 over a year ago, and I lent you my limited edition sneakers to wear, not to mention that you met with Jack with me before, and it was my treat. You got so many favors and you still come to me for money?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"We can't settle accounts like this. You lent me sneakers before, and I've lent you my hat too. Besides, you owe me a total of 1000 CAD; we can't just write it off like that. I'm really tight on money lately, and I'm almost unable to pay my rent. If you don't pay me back, I'll be evicted by the landlord.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"Your hat? Who cares about your hat? Are you clear about the value of the sneakers I lent you before? For 1,000 bucks and you're still coming to me? I don't want to talk to you anymore, you're an ungrateful man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,B,I've been really busy lately and haven't had much time to clean up after myself. I didn't think a few dishes in the sink would be a big deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,It's not just about a few dishes; it's the cumulative effect of not cleaning up. It makes the space unpleasant for everyone else. We need to stick to the cleaning schedule we agreed upon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not the only one who uses the kitchen. Why am I being singled out? Are you sure I left the dirty dishes in the kitchen?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encourage exchanges of information, 3. Let the parties know that their concerns are understood, 4. Promote a productive level of emotional expression","Hi everyone, I understand tensions are high given the situation. A should provide more information about specific needs or constraints for this evening. B should understand that the reunion cannot be changed and requires immediate attention. Additionally, B should recognize the significant impact on A's evening plans and act in a more understanding way to find an immediate solution, rather than offering a table two hours later.",30,300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Smith. I believe we have already provided services for a Mr. Smith. It seems there was a mix-up with our booking system. We are fully booked tonight, but we can offer you a table at 9 PM as a compromise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,A,"That's unacceptable. I made this reservation weeks ago, and I have guests waiting. This ruins our evening plans. What can you do to make this right now, not two hours later?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If evidences certify the heavy noises occur every nights, it is important for B to ask A's neighbors to reduce it.",65,225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,B,"It's normal for people to walk upstairs, this house is very old and the soundproofing is just not good, I will help to warn them, but I can't force them to solve it, and you have no evidence to prove that the noise they are making is beyond the law. So I can't ask someone to change anything just because of your words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
